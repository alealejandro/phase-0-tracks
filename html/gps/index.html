<!-- 
1. The main purpose is to organize the content of the html page. One of the most useful elements is the <nav>, because it contains links to all the pages on the website.
2. The browsers displays the elements from top to bottom.
3. We got a better understanding of how snippets work and how to make them. Also that sublime allows to make custom snippets. If there is a new block of code which is repeatedly used and it would save time, it would be a good idea to make a snippet for it.
4. During to part regarding semantic elements we had to use elements that we were unfamiliar with their use. Using the documentations to improve our understanding of these elements. Also with practice we will gain more understanding of how to use these elements.
