Release 0

	I'll go through w3schools to get a feel for the language, and briefly glance through the jquery docs (jquery.com), then bookmark/index it.

	Because the w3schools have try-it-yourself sections, I would stop to test what I've learned for every new method, unless I feel I get the gist of it.

	I'll break every hour.

	I just have to keep an eye on the BIG PICTURE & SELECTIVELY TAKE NOTES, not for every little detail.

	Positive mindset.

Release 1

	Positive growth mindset.

	Big picture focus - need to do more of, am focusing a bit too much on the details still, though not as much.

	The exercises helped solidify the material - good to actually try it out by hand, not just read about it.

	Take breaks when losing that mindset, when not in the present & curious.

	Maybe skim references before diving into the specific pages?
