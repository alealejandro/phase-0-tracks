	<h1>Appreciating Music</h1>
	<h2>Imaging Sounds in a 3-D Space</h2>
	<p>We relate to sound in 2 ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We <b>feel &amp; hear</b> the physical sound waves that come out of the speakers</li>
		<li>We <b>imagine the apparent placement</b> of sounds between the speakers</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The latter perception of sound offers 3 basic parameters of sound corresponding to the X, Y, Z axes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>X: <b>Panning</b> is the <b>left/right</b> placement of sounds between the speakers.</li>
		<li>Y: <b>Frequency</b> is the <b>low/high</b> placement of sounds:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Instruments with high pitches, like cymbals and high strings, seem higher than those of low frequencies, such as bass guitars and kickdrums</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Z: <b>Volume</b> is the <b>front/back</b> placement of sounds:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Sounds that are closer to us are louder, and distant sounds are softer.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>The <b id = "aom">Art of Mixing</b> is the <b>creative placement and movement</b> of these sound images. To learn more about imaging sounds, check out <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Art-Mixing-Recording-Engineering-Production/dp/1931140456">David Gibson's Book, "The Art of Mixing"</a></p>

	<h2>Other Site Review</h2>

	<p>I liked <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_art_of_mixing_will_blow_your_mind">Dangerous Minds' Website</a> regarding the art of mixing. It has a clear navigation bar, and the content is sectioned off &amp; displayed in such a manner (as opposed to just filling the page).</p>
