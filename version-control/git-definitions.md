# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is useful because it allows us to view the entire history of revisions to 1 or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. With version control, we can rollback the document to any of these points on the timeline.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branches represent save point features, and are useful for version control - they enable focus on a specific feature for initial development and testing. If a branch meets certain expectations, they can be merged back into the master branch. Branching allows you to discard a feature/experiment that didn't turn out quite like you hoped.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point. A good commit message describes what has been done in detail, and states what was changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when there have been multiple changes made to a file by multiple actors - Git will recognize the changes, but won't know which change to go ahead with over the other.
